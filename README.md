# VocabTracker

A simple command line tool for keeping track of vocabulary as we learn through a subject.
Currenty you can add,remove or search for a word in the dictionary.

# Adding a word to dictionary
vocab --add \<word\> \<meaning\>  
  or  
vocab -a \<word\> \<meaning\>  
  
# Searching for a word in dictionary
vocab --search \<word\>  
  or  
vocab -s \<word\>  
  
# Remove a word from dictionary
vocab --remove \<word\>  
  or  
vocab -r \<word\>  
  
Shall add the edit meaning functionality later.
